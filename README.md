# Write-ups and Notes for CTFs

Basically all my writeups and notes to everything I learn while doing CTFs.
I'm still getting started, so there's a lot of pretty basic stuff in the notes, but just jotting them down for my own sake.

Right now, I'm focusing on overthewire.org and all the cool challenges they have there.
